# bitsy (v8.12, + multiplayer editor)

~ a little engine for little games, worlds, and stories ~

## make a game with bitsy

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
or
```
npm run client && server
```
Server runs on `localhost:3000` by default. Open the client at `localhost:8080`.

The address bar will now have your instance string, e.g.  
`http://localhost:8080/?instance=4CDQ9qsgqS4bQ1gfxUwFhy8q5WHX`  
Copy this address to another client to join the shared session.
